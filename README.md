# Hello stranger!
I'm Cain, a senior full-stack software engineer passionate about building, whether it's making software or creating physical thigngs. My interests span across 3D printing, space, and all things creative; I love just bringing an idea to life and solving a problem gives me a lot of dopamine.

I've explored game development, web development, app development, backend development, and cloud technologies, amongst many other things, always seeking new challenges to push myself further. I have a habit of starting stupidly ambitious projects (I've been toying with the idea of making rocket) even when I don't start with a clue on how to do them, I tend to learn along the way and honestly, I think it's the best way too learn.

Always happy to connect and maybe collaborate on something cool! Feel free to reach out if interested!

<h3 align="center">Printeresting</h3>

Currently, I'm working on [Printeresting](https://printeresting.co.uk), a startup that combines my love for making and innovation. I sell products directly to customers via [Etsy](https://printerestingin3d.etsy.com) and am scaling up [printeresting.co.uk](https://printeresting.co.uk) to provide solutions for businesses to help with their marketting.

It's mainly just an outlet for me to create things that I find interesting, but I figured I might as well do something with it so other's get to enjoy some of the things that I make too.

Some of the things I make are open-source and you can/will be able to find them over on thingiverse and makerlab too, with the same username @ashmoreinc, keep an eye out there because I plan to be putting more on there.

## Here's one of the project's Im pretty proud of

### [Crowd Simulation Engine](https://github.com/ashmoreinc/Generic-Crowd-Simulation-Engine)

This was my dissertation project in Uni, the goal was to make a simulation engine which could be adapted to simulate how humans navigate around each other in different situations.

I was particularly interested in making sure it's accurate, basing some of the scenarios that I crafted against real-life situations. 
Like when there are to counter-flowing crowds in a corridoor, people tend to naturally form lines and fall into a sort of slip-stream.
Or when a crowd of people are trying to get through a pinch point, like a door way, then they tend to form a sort of dome/semi-circle cluster around that door as people filter through it.

This was cool to observe in the project, especially since this behaviour wasn't explicity programmed into the system, rather each of the people (agents) making their own decisions about their own movement, based on their preferences, environment, goal/destination and the people around them.

I've recently been thinking that this could be cool to adapt into a system which does the same thing but for how birds fly in groups.

The system was built in unity and I would have loved to have done more with it, maybe I will one day, who knows.
